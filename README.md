# Cat vs Dog Open-Kattis

Here I present an alternate method for solving the contest problem on Kattis by using a flow network 
with Ford Fulkerson's algorithm (using DFS) to calculate the size of the maximal matching set (i.e. 
a minimum vertex cover set) on a bipartite graph - as would be the model for this problem since
cat lovers and dog lovers are defined as mutually exclusive.
